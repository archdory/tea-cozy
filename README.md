ISSUES I RAN INTO:

1. Placing the word "Locations" above the different address boxes without affecting the vertical-centering of the boxes.
FIX: Using relative/absolute positioning for that h2-element. However this doesn't display properly in FireFox.

2. Background images of divs did not exactly match the example website. Mine appeared to be "zoomed in", not show everything.

3. Need to re-lookup how to display error text for images if they do-not load properly.

4. Still struggling how I should best implement 'flex grow/shrink/etc.' to ensure website scales properly when browser resizes.
